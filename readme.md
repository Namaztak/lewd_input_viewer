An input viewer, presently for playing Tetris, that also interacts with [Intiface Central.](https://intiface.com/central/)

Only currently supports one toy at a time, and unless you're willing to dig into the source code, it's only gonna really work if you play Tetris on my same symmetrical Colemak layout.

To do:  
* ~~Just make it increase intensity on ALL keyboard and controller inputs.~~
* Make it easy to rebind the relevant keys for the actual viewer part.
