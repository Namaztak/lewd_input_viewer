An input viewer, presently for playing Tetris, that also interacts with [Intiface Central.](https://intiface.com/central/)

Only currently supports one toy at a time.  

Change your keybinds in globals.py

To do:  
* ~~Just make it increase intensity on ALL keyboard and controller inputs.~~  
* Make it easy to rebind the relevant keys for the actual viewer part.  
* Make it so controller inputs also map to the viewer buttons.
